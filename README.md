- 👋 (Introduction) Hi, I’m Andrii Khomitskyi from Ukraine (country the east of Europe), for Internet users usually @M1zZantroP. I'm 21. Nowadays I finishing study in my university (Master's degree). And I plan to work as a programmer in an interesting company.
- 👀 (Hobbies) I’m interested in coding and solving difficult problems. I also play guitar (and a little bit on contrabass) from 2010 until today. In fact, reading musical notes is even easier than reading the code for solving problemsin one line on codewars.com)
- 🌱 (Practice) I'm currently learning python core and support my skills about database and more.
- 💞️ (Wishes) I would like to work with a cool team that solves interesting problems for clients. I really want to keep up with the times, learn the best professional practices from senior colleagues. Well, of course, often spend free time with the team (I'm a fan of outdoor activities).
- 📫 (Contact) Fortunately, I hate social networks because it takes up a lot of my free time and I prefer to use that time for my hobbies or sports. And to communicate with me you have to use a telegram-messenger http://t.me/DeaD_CoNDoR or an older version - e-mail-adress: homitskiy.andriy@gmail.com
