- 👋 (Introduction) Hi, I’m Andrii Khomitskyi from Ukraine (a country in the east of Europe), for Internet users usually @DoesNotMatter. I'm 22. Nowadays I've got a master's degree in Software Engineering. And I want to work as a programmer in an interesting company.
- 👀 (Hobbies) I’m interested in coding, sites development, and solving difficult problems. Also, I play the guitar (and a little bit on contrabass) from 2010 until today. In fact, reading musical notes is even easier than reading the strange code for solving problems in one line on codewars.com ;)
- 🌱 (Practice) Currently, I'm deepening in back-end Python development. For this, I use the Django framework and a little bit of Flask. As for databases I usually work with Postgres, MySQL and have a bit of experience with NoSQL (like Mongo). Also, I like writing useful scripts that will be making my life easier in the future (like looking for a new car).
- 💞️ (Wishes) I would like to work with a cool team that solves interesting problems for clients. I really want to keep up with the times, learn the best professional practices from senior colleagues. Well, of course, often spend free time with the team (I'm a fan of outdoor activities).
- 📫 (Contact) Fortunately, I hate social networks because it takes up a lot of my free time and I prefer to use that time for my hobbies or sports. And to communicate with me you have to use a telegram-messenger http://t.me/HasNoMatter or an older version - e-mail-adress: homitskiy.andriy@gmail.com
